# CoffeaHZZAnalysis

Based on https://github.com/atlas-outreach-data-tools/notebooks-collection-opendata/blob/master/13-TeV-examples/uproot_python/HZZAnalysis.ipynb.

Still missing the crosssection weight calculations that would make the output the same as the original.

I don't want to have the processor use list comprehensions, but the other ways that I have tried haven't worked.
